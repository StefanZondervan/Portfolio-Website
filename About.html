            <p>The wall above my couch displays a large map of our world during the interbellum from the Japanese perspective, with Japan at the center and Europe and the USA situated somewhere in the periphery. This visual display serves as a constant reminder of my profound interest in the transformative power of perspective. As a dyslexic and visually oriented individual, I've always struggled with remembering things through words and reading. Instead, I've relied on storytelling in a visual format since I was young. It's my way of sharing my perspective and making sense of the world.</p>
  
              <p>My artistic journey is one of exploration, evolution, and an unwavering commitment to storytelling. While I have yet to settle on a singular medium, I find my creative expression through a diverse range of channels, including coding, books, publications, installations, and physical works. This openness to experimentation allows me to adapt my artistic medium to best convey the narratives and subjects that resonate with me, forging a profound connection with my audience.</p>
  
              <p>What distinguishes my work is an unrelenting attention to detail and a dedication to crafting precise narratives. I believe in the power of storytelling to engage, educate, and provoke thought. My projects are meticulously designed to serve a purpose - to tell a story where every element converges to create a coherent and immersive experience.</p>

              <p>Themes of (neo)colonialism, displacement, cultures, minorities, history, borders, and geopolitics captivate my imagination and are close to my heart. I perceive these themes as interconnected threads within a broader system, and through my work, I aim to spotlight the individuals who often find themselves at the center of these narratives.</p>

            <p>I draw inspiration from the world around me, constantly seeking to understand the forces that shape our reality. Museums and art serve as my visual catalogue, enriching my creative palette and allowing me to draw from a deep well of knowledge and insight.</p>
  
            <p>Ultimately, my artistic mission is to inform and immerse. I aspire to provide audiences with experiences that encourage critical thinking about the world we inhabit, fostering a sense of consciousness and a (un)conscious call to action.</p>
  
            <p>My upbringing alongside my twin brother, who lives with a disability, has been a profound influence on my perspective. It has revealed the inherent inequalities and injustices present in our constructed societal norms. His unwavering determination serves as a constant reminder that despite life's challenges, hard work and resilience can overcome any obstacle.</p>

            <p>As I journey forward, I aspire to explore diverse stories of people and cultures, continually pushing the boundaries of my artistic expression. I envision my work evolving into more experimental forms as I search for the perfect medium to convey the stories that captivate my curiosity and bring them to life for others to experience.</p>

            <p>“In this ever-changing artistic exploration, I invite you to join me in discovering the myriad stories that make up our complex world, to challenge preconceptions, and to embrace the power of storytelling as a catalyst for understanding, empathy, and change”</p>
