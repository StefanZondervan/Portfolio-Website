          <p>In a collaborative effort, my fellow student, of Palestinian descent, and I embarked on a deeply personal project aimed at providing information about the systemic oppression faced by the Palestinian population under Israeli occupation. Our chosen canvas was the city of Bethlehem, a place with profound significance, as it resonated with the experiences of my partner's family, who had to flee their homeland due to the ravages of war and fear of persecution.</p>

            <p>Our passion for justice and a shared sense of injustice towards the Palestinian people drove us to create an installation that would not only inform but also evoke empathy and inspire action. The plight of the Palestinian people became deeply personal, especially for my partner, whose connection to Bethlehem lent a poignant perspective.</p>

            <p>Our journey began with rigorous research, seeking to understand and accurately represent the oppressive systems enforced by the Israeli government in Bethlehem. These systems included roadblocks, towering walls, illegal settlements, and roads accessible only to Israeli citizens. With a wealth of information at our disposal, we deliberated on the most effective way to visually convey this reality and foster a connection between viewers and the people of Bethlehem.</p>

            <p>The core design elements of our installation were both striking and informative. We projected an interactive map of Bethlehem onto a topographic cut-out of the city, meticulously highlighting roadblocks, walls, illegal settlements, and exclusive roads. This fusion of technology and tactile representation aimed to engage the audience on multiple levels.</p>

            <p>Our choice of materials was crucial to the project's success. We employed foam in a CNC machine, which expertly carved out the topographic layout of Bethlehem and its surroundings, providing a frame for our projection. To bring our vision to life, we coded the information, seamlessly integrating it into the projection mapped onto the foam cut-out.</p>

            <p>Maintaining objectivity and accuracy proved to be a significant challenge, but our dedication to providing the most precise information prevailed. Countless hours of research and discussions enabled us to create a presentation that was both informative and accessible to all.</p>

            <p>Our goal was to create an installation that would visualize the struggles faced by the Palestinian population under Israeli occupation, fostering awareness and empathy. The feedback we received was overwhelmingly positive, with visitors, including Israeli citizens, commending our project's ability to convey the stark realities in a visual and impactful manner.</p>

            <p>This installation, "Awdah: Bethlehem, the People of Palestine,‚Äù serves as a poignant testament to the resilience and struggles of the Palestinian people, inviting viewers to stand in solidarity and advocate for a more just future.</p>
